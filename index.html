            Hi, I'm Samuel James Whitwicky! <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f44b.png" width="60px"/>
          </h1>
          <p>
            I am a teenager who is friends with a group of alien robots from the planet cybertron. They call themselves autobots.
            My grandfather was the first to discover them on an excavation trip to antartica. He found a robot frozen in ice and after
            accidentally triggering a button he was struck by an electrical shockwave which sadly took his life. I have been trying to 
            help the autobots get back to cybertron by trying to locate a cube that can open a portal to their world.

          Samuel james Whitwicky has been an asset to the autobots. Without him we would have lost hope
          in ever making it back to Cybertron. His faith, courage and extreme dedications has
          made it possible to look for a brighter futre for our race. His skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript,
          Java, SQL, React and Node.js has been more than we could have bargained for. There is more to him than meets the eye.

          I had worked along with Sam during the initial phase of our venture which needed Web development. 
          He is a committed resource who has in depth knowledge about the domain. 
          He will be an asset for any organisation! - Ratchet
